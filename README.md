# pop-music-pandemic
In this project, my group partners and I examined how popular music listening changed during and since the covid-19 pandemic. 
We used exploratory data analysis and machine learning. We examined music features using Spotify's API as they related to the Billboard Top 100 charts over the last several years. 
One interesting finding was that people listened to more happy music during the pandemic.
